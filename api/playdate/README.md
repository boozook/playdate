Done. Now take a look at long way below for details what's happen.

#### Alternative Way

Just run `cargo new <your options>` and add do following:
1. Add [playdate crate][playdate-crate] as dependency to your project
1. `#![no_std]` for library, or `#![no_std] #![no_main]` for executable binary
1. Look at existing example for api-parts [like that][sprite-examples]
1. Add minimally required metadata to build package:
	- `package.metadata.playdate.bundle-id = "com.yourcompany.game"`
	- Read about [playdate metadata format][] if needed
1. Install [cargo-playdate][] to build your project
1. Run `cargo playdate run`
1. Help this project somehow.
